# Todo App

This is a simple React-based Todo application that allows users to add, edit, delete, and filter their tasks. It supports basic functionalities such as creating a task, updating the task's status, and filtering tasks based on their completion status. The project uses the `useState` hook to manage state and `react-icons` for iconography.
